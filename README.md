Hi my name is Sid! I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelor's of Science in Geography and GIS with a minor in Criminology, Law, and Society. After graduation, I began the masters program here at the University of Arizona as well as being employed at a fiber optic internet company. Outside of my education and work experience, I enjoy watching motorsports, competing in triathlons, and snowboarding!
